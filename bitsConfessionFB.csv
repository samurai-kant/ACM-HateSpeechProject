I at any point of time can share those evidence with the AUGSD/IC and I will ensure that you all get to suffer the repurcussion for the deeds committed.(If you don't know then the bare minimum punishment would be - debarrment for a semester)  PS: It's shameful to see so many people getting involved in cheating.

Barring a couple of courses I don't think you'll have evals immediately after test 2. Take that break and study for half the time of what you're doing now. Maybe go for a walk and get some fresh air.

People end up doing something which they don't like,. Even in research how many of us even know about how to publish a research paper. Just know? Hardly you will find such. At the end money matters to decide your success. Within a college of 1000+ hardly 15-20 people have been going for foreign studies. The ℅ is very less compared to what it was before.

Instagram models who have made a career by posting half-naked images and have a predominantly male following now bash the same men for objectifying women. By default, the reels, and stories Instagram and Facebook suggest to me usually involve young females wearing provocative clothes, dancing to some songs while making suggestive faces or doing something very similar to that. Soon after that, gaining a few thousand followers, these 'influencers' get advertisers who use their very sexuality to sell products and then these models become expert on every socio-political issue.

It's just because we don't want to highlight the upper caste by using such terms. So why then recognise backward caste alone. The government is just playing a trick, just remind the backward caste people that they belong to backward caste, and this cycle goes on and on.

We join into colleges to improve ourselves in all areas , till 12th class we might be interested in many aspects but couldnot get the oppurtunity to explore, and after joining into college the clubs conducts tests for entering . Wtf !!!! Can someone explain what this system is ? In iits the system is far way fuckin better than ours. Here many clubs before entering into the club they adevertise with a fake tag ""no prerequisites required"" and after attempting the test, they expect us to show some previous projects or give us ome assignment in fields in which we are new.  This is the concern for many students in our clg . And you would be shocked if you get to know about the club system in iits. ******** ********* So the heads of clubs and depts are answerable to my question . Why is the recuritment system this much weird in so called tier-1 reputed institute bits pilani? If you cannot justify yourself , you must admit thst you are such a big dumbass."

And also they are not even interested in working hard and bringing up their level as they are completely aware of this screwed hiring system. They know that they'll bag the dream companies even if they put in negligible efforts with 0 talent. Please girls, start working hard so that without any form of quota, the ratio of selected girls : selected boys becomes > 1 and this hiring process improves a bit.  I would love if girls could become more competent and beat us(guys) but this hiring system is pulling girls back from working hard and helping them in just free loading.

Do they feel a sense of security, knowing that their boyfriend is already placed/has high chances of getting placed, and hence their life is sorted? Is this the reason why we have so many gold diggers and sugar daddy's on our campus?  Whatever be the case, one thing is for certain, when it's my time to get placed, I'll have to take every step to ensure I don't become a victim of this trap.

From what | know , no such transfers have been given in Pilani and Goa . Well here comes the best part, one of the students to get aCS transfer was the daughter of a professor. Did you know about this ? Probably no coz no announcement was done before the allotment ? Now all other transfers are scheduled to happen in december and other students who may get another branches(eg. Ece or rev.dual)are supposed to almost waste one entire semester. Is it fair to give only transfers to CS? Conspiracy? 🤔"

Same thing is valid for Intern season just CG cutoff will 7.5+(safer side).  Even if you don't know that much coding, you will be placed and will get intern.  I don't know why this things doesn't happen in other colleges. In IITS same companies are open for all irrespective of CG and Branch but here only 3 branches CS/EEE/ENI.

Unless you are an economics student of course, then you're fine regardless of CG.

Even I haven't heard anything about core companies coming for these sectors for the placements.  Why do I always feel that you guys only care about the CS and EEE students and other are non existent. Many of us were forced to go for the first sem placements against our will and there is one of you saying that if you have any problem sit in sem 2 placements. Seriously man, we are not doing this because we want to, but because we are forced to.  I am not here just to rant, but to know what is going to happen to us guys.

The number of opportunities available to these branches are just so minute in comparison to CS even in the top tier colleges. No matter how hard you work, only top 4-5 students will be able to land in their desired field and other students would have to shift to either IT, finance, consulting roles. The students of these branch have to study their branches as well as they have to study n number of things in order to get placed. Return of investment is literally shit if you are studying in these branches and with the depleting brand value of the BITS tag , I dont know what will happen when the tag bubble of BITS will burst. Tips to juniors: Dont rely on the tag so much and go out and hunt for jobs, internships on your own. Develop skills that would help you score a decent placements.

Maybe he still loves his ex. He has stopped responding to my messages lately, he does but after waiting for 4-5 hours or so. I understand how busy he is but it’s getting difficult to wait.

When the government of India couldn't do anything, do you think the argument that this guy has an ipHoNe will stand as a solid proof? Legit lol  You want to do something? Write UPSC, get into GoI in whatever department that deals with tax evasion. Then focus on tax records of BITSians' parents. If you can't do that then sorry honey you can't do nothing so stop dividing your own community.  You want to reduce fees because middle class students will not be able to afford BITS. But then you attack the provisions made by the institute for those same candidates. Irony much? BITS admin actually increased MCN after the 2018 protests lmao.

Make it a nation-wide movement. Even other colleges aren't reducing fees. They're even taking fees of hostel and mess. So involve all the colleges. Tag UGC and GOI in twitter. Tag your buddies from IIT, NIT, VIT, etc. Pressurise the government to take some action. To make some rule to collect only necessary fees. This way, our Institute won't be defamed and some result can be expected. Unite the student community all over India. Let's do this guys, c'mon..."

"3544","  Procedure to go online anonymously:- If we need to get to 100k tweets, we must have an online army of 2000 anonymous twitter accounts, each tweeting about 50 tweets in a given period of 30-45 mins or so.  This can be achieved with the support of about 2000 students with 1 anonymous account, or 1000 students with 2 anonymous accounts.  We need a pre-thought out, tweet bank, with genuine concerns from parents, students and guardians. We need a folder full of memes, or normal images which can be tweeted along with the decided hashtag.  A Google drive account needs to be created and made accessible to every person to contribute his/her memes or tweets in the form of a document or a folder with pics.  When the stipulated time comes, every person needs to pick 50 random messages from the bank (memes, genuine messages and concerns) or they can just tweet the hashtag only, from each account they have made.  We need to tag many media houses and accounts which can make a difference."
"3542","  Replying to #3538  It is good that someone is finally putting up this confession. I want to add a few things. One of the points made was that everyone pays ""a few more thousands"". I guess the person who made this confession meant that every semester we pay a few more thousands. The total across all semesters probably comes out near 2 lakhs at least for single degree students and around 2.5 lakhs at least(approx) for dualites. I made these rough calculations (please feel free to suggest a better number) looking at the number of non Alumni backed MCN scholarships. Now tell me, would you allow anybody (friend or whoever) to steal this kind of money from you? Most of the people claiming are fake MCN scholarships are much richer than those who honestly pay their fees, the ones paying fees mostly belong to salaried parents. This is daylight robbery. It feels hard to digest that such and inefficient system exists at this level. We have taken this issue LITE for too long. Its them to #expose them.  Admin's note - Seconded"

I myself was a part of the discussion in my 1st year when were making the list. It's nothing but just a ranking of how good one looks and how cool is she. Not even a single thought was put upon their ""assets"" or anything. And don't tell me that you don't rank boys out based on their looks(if not openly, then atleast inside your head). Infact we all do and it depends on the individual how you take it. But comparing it with the bois locker room case is complete bullshit and probably just girls trying to play the victim card. Though there could have been past incidents in their life where they could have faced gender based bullying, but ssly leave BB out of this thing."

There should be a bar on this , if it's a good institution it does not mean they can take as much fees as they can . They should understand that they are nothing without students and if they don't keep the fee constant we should raise our voice . If we stand strong and don't step back then they have to think about fee increase . The amount they increase every year , our parents hardly get that much increment and our parents also need to do savings for their future. Please do think about it , otherwise we are going to have tough times ahead ."

"2986","  This is outrageous. How can the college administration dare to even ask for the fees for a mundane ""Work from Home"" PS1.  They have proved it again that we are just money minting machines for them.  Even in this situation how can they expect us to pay that huge amount. Many of our parents have recieved a pay cut and many haven't even recieved their salaries. What do they expect from us, to spend our savings? They are for the future in case this thing continues for a long time.  Also why are they demanding this fees this time. Till last time they used to have a reason of paying the prof and the TA for their salaries during the PS. Now what will they do to deserve this.  In my opinion, we should organize a collective protest organised accross the three campuses, making our demands clear and explaining our extreme situations. I would like the SU to interfere in this matter and make sure our voices are reached to their deaf ears.  2(won't mention my gender as its on behalf of the entire second year batch)"

Does the insti actually believe that their students will be freely going out to various corners of the country, interacting within functional companies and doing actual summer internships in almost 30 days from now?

"2813","  Tldr - Nitin Chaturvedi has rescinded Mup buffers. We need them back. Post - Nitin Chaturvedi has been completely unfair to us. Scaling up marks or giving us more assignments would make us sad but we would still live with it. Removing buffers is a hostile act that shows his apathy, his pathetic sense of justice, and indicates he clearly isn't up-to-date on day to day matters, because he believes we spread this pandemic. Why is removing buffers unfair? Suppose a student was sick and couldn't attend a tut. Suppose a student had a chance to participate in a prestigious competition and missed a lab. This happened with them knowing they will have a buffer at the start of the sem. If you feel that what he has done to such people is fair then let me know. Let me tell you sir, we are not responsible for this position the world is in. So please do not punish us by removing our buffers. Do some work yourself and give us an assignment for all we care. We will be sad but we will do it. But please don't remove our buffers."
"2812","  Seriously, who do we approach to remove Nitin Chaturvedi as MUP IC? We need our buffers back. Scale up karna hai toh scale up kar, par buffers are a true requirement. It is absolutely unfair and he is indirectly blaming us for this pandemic. Aur Nitin Chaturvedi sun, chutiye jab campus khulega tab tujhe pata chal jaega ki mai kon hun, I don't care tu mujhse kitna bada hai. Tere body ka har ek curve flat kar dunga. Aisa danda ghusau ga ki tatti zindagi bhar nipples se niklegi. Aise chaalu maarunga ki khoon bhi bahar nahi aana chahega. Yaad rakhna madarchod."

I am just loving the thought of what we could do if we were friends, and this used to make my every day happy. But due to this lockdown situations😷, I have started to miss you a lot. Now Facebook, Instagram photos aren't working anymore. I just wish this situation gets over soon and I get to see you again 😌😌.

He will give a common assignment, and we will happily copy from each other. Plus MATLAB Sas ke lie sikhna hi hai.

"2537","  Ok, so this has been bothering me since I got home for the ""vacation"". I was sitting at the airport, waiting for my flight when a girl came and took a seat in front of me. She was wearing a message tee with a GoT quote on it. I am a fan of the show and I tried to do what a good fan would do; I tried to read the quote(""I am not a Princess, I am a Khaleesi"" for anyone wondering). It would have been alright if I simply read the quote and moved on. But I read it for so long it far exceeded the time for it to be considered as staring. But, the main problem is that I did so with my tongue sticking out and after I finished I looked at her, smiled(more like grinned) and a let out a ""nice"" which wasn't to myself. She heard, saw, judged, called me a pervert and left. Although I can be one sometimes, I don't do so in public and definitely wasn't doing it this time. So I have two questions: How do I read messages written on people's tees especially girls' and if they are not to be read why do you wear them?  PS: Is it called a ""vacation"" because we have to ""vacate"" our hostel?"

"2509","  Sorry to be putting a depressing confession here. But I really need to get it out. I am sick of being who i am, tired of everything that is going around, tired of asking for help, tired of begging people to stay. Every single day it is getting harder to get out even when people tell me that it will get better. I've almost lost everything I used to be happy about, every single moment feels like eternity. Every day I want to keep on crying for hours thinking that probably I'll feel better after that but it just gets worse. When I ask for help I feel like the other people are just looking at me like a project that needs to be fixed. Every single wrong doing of mine comes rushing to me and it is just too hard to ask for help anymore."

"2425","  This is not a love confession or anything. I just want to know everyone's opinion because I don't know how to discuss this openly. So I am usually the butt of jokes most of the time in my wing group and normally I don't mind them as such. Sometimes I don't react angrily just because I think it's natural for friends to make fun of each other. But the problem is that even if we are talking about someone else, it kind of circles back to me and then they start making fun. It gets to the point where if I even open my mouth during a candid talk, I am made fun of. I usually take it in good spirit but sometimes I feel unwanted in the group and I'm not able to openly express myself. Of course it doesn't help either that I am sort of introvert and my wing group is kind of the only close group there is for me. I don't know what to do about this and it's recently being plaguing my mind. Any suggestions would be helpful. Thanks."

"2403","  All relationships begin, with the promise of rainbows and butterflies, and support in the time of storms. Eventually, you realise that even in a relationship, it's still 'each man for himself' and how the other person keeps on hurting you. It feels like you're a hurdle in their life, you were something they wanted to have, and now that they have it, they disregard you- take you for granted, don't care about you anymore like they used to. It makes you blame your true-self. Maybe they don't care about you like they used to, because they don't like the real you, now that they know every little thing about you. It makes you wonder how easy and devoid of self-hate life would've been if you were single and hadn't gone in a relationship. All of this, just makes me feel althemore alone in this place."

Don't thank the girl yet, she didn't do that on purpose so that you feel great in being alone, she just finds you inadequate for her, and she is also looking. Don't think of yourself as more or less than others so that you don't hurt anyone or feel hurt, try to create a balance in life. Because remember, it is the time, this place and these people, they change all the time, so you also change."

You made me mature enough to realize that love is a fleeting emotion and the only true happiness can be achieved is by spending time on oneself. Once you left me, I devoted my time on new things, exploring my hidden strengths, and trust me, I felt better. Now I look back and realize how funny it was that I fell for you. I ain't gonna name you because I still respect you but I want to sincerely thank you for making me a more mature and responsible person.

Whatever point you guys are trying to make or the pleasure you are assuming in defaming someone is very ugly, however you might look on outside.

I think there are many people like me who are not clear whether to go for PS2 during 1st Sem or 2nd sem. It would be helpful for many of us if we can have a talk or some informative session about this soon. Also, a little bit about the dream attempt. Are there any successful dream attempt(s) during 1st or 2nd semester of this year's placements seasons?  I don't know whom to reach to have this kind of session, so if you guys do know please pass it on to the relevant person so that we all can benefit from it."

"2170","  I fucking hate this women in tech shit. Why do women who have been into colleges like BITS and IIT need a push? Arent you privileged enough already. With all the recruiters showing great bias toward taking women candidates instead of male ones just for the diversity shit. I mean come on. First reservations and now this. Half of the girls recruited in faang dont even have an iota of knowledge as compared to a simple boy in a 10 lpa job and all this is due to gender diversity bull shit. In my honest opinion excessively privileged girls like in BITS dont deserve preferential treatment like women in tech. If you have any self respect come and take away jobs in a level field. Dont say we got through in internships, you know why you were even made an offer. You dont need coding skills and we all know that!"

Being a shy girl myself I'm very happy that you're also in eco otherwise i would have never been able to see you regularly.

"2093","  It's Valentine's soon and I don't wanna be single this year. I wish I was a guy. It's easier for you people to ask someone out. We, on the other hand, get labelled as sluts and accept it or not, a girl asking a guy out is not attractive. Though I specifically mean on campus. Elsewhere I think it is. Anyway, getting back on point, if you like someone and wanna know them better then I would suggest that rather than just passing smiles, try talking. And it's pretty obvious if or not she's interested in you. She smiles back at you. And when you are in a group and everyone's laughing, she looks at you. It's human tendency. Pick up the hints. Get motivated enough and please do it. Just think how dumb it is to not have this experience just because you are not sure. And for the record, most of us were pretty sure about engineering and look where it landed us. I'm sure this person is worth more. They are obviously more interesting and you don't have to invest so much. So overall it's worth giving a try."

The girl in manufacturing, third year. You have talked to me only once in whatsapp, I tried to flirt but you diverted the topic. You were very kind and calm and perfect girl I wanted. I admire you a lot, be happy. 4. The girl in msc eco, second yearite. The cutest girl on the campus. I like you a lot but scare to approach you.

And itna confidence mein keh sakta Hun kisi aur ko problem mein daalke fookna humein bhi nahi pasand hai. There are a bunch of people that genuinely came to us in our hostel and said bro tumhare yahan fookne pe halka suffocating lagta hai. We don’t smoke near his room now. So instead of whining like a bitch, go and talk to those people. Tell them bro yahan smoke mat kiya karo. I think smokers are the most cooperating people. And to the Buddh Hrep.

I was in my room in the middle of the night cosily enjoying the warness of my quilt while browsing random shit on YouTube .... Suddenly one of my wingies ""came"" and asked me about random things.....and then started strokingy leg gently via the quilt ( that smile though) then he bent his ass and brought his face towards me ..... Both me and my roomie were traumatized for life....... If roomie hadn't been in the room ... I think I might have lost my virginity ( forcefully). But there he stopped after realising that i am not *****......  SR resident +1 if you feel my pain"

"1497","  Something I noticed recently. I'm mostly attracted to men who have worked hard in life, have a particular charm and they have developed it themselves. They look cool because they have worked for it. Their smile is the smile of success mixed with humility. I tried to analyze the pattern of men I find attractive. They are heroes. Saviors. I know it's clichè but that's how it is. Moreover, I, myself, am a mess. I can't think straight and I don't have a plan in life. I don't think I'm ever gonna be the kind of person that I'm attracted to. So if everyone is like me, then no one will like me. Cause if I were you, I wouldn't be attracted to myself. Now this entire situation is too bad. Because then no one would want to be with people like me. And people like me desperately need love and support to get out of the mess. Are there people out there who can fall for someone who's miserable? Someone who doesn't know their shit? Plz share your experiences so that I can have hope. Also I need validation."

"1362","  I’m writing this confession here after watching a mess worker actually publicly fight my batchie in the mess just because he asked for one extra egg during breakfast. I understand there are rules, but it’s not like we are in scarcity. I’ve seen those mess workers genuinely eat four or five eggs after the breakfast timings are over. On Sundays I’ve seen them eat more chicken than five of us together could eat. I don’t understand why is there a limit on how much one can eat. People have different appetites. And above all we pay a hefty sum to get food for ourselves and not the mess workers. Don’t get me wrong, I am all for helping the underprivileged, but this sort of entitlement and behaviour by workers simply pisses me off. If any mess rep is reading, kindly do something.

"1293","  In reply to #1289.  See that's what happens when you are thrown in a bird-cage with 12:1 gender ratio. Guys naturally, are less choosy and girls are more spoilt for choice. Don't convert this fact into a pedestal you can just hop on to say that girls are any better. When a guy gets a few too many confessions, we call them fake confessions. When a girl gets multiple confessions, it's because she has fair skin and the guys are desperate. Lol. I believe, if there is any truth in your assumptions, it's just a consequence of the damn ratio. I could argue that Pilani girls are unyielding to the approaching guys to an unpleasant extent, and that they feed off the attention they receive. But, it's again, because of the demography. So, just saying, it's not that Pilani girls are nuns or anything."

"1266","  Reply to #1234  I am not sure if you want to hook up with a specific person or if you're simply looking to try it out. If you have a specific person in mind that you think you can trust, talk to them and find out casually if they are into hookups. If they are, then proceed. Otherwise, try your luck with another person.  If you are looking for a new person, I don't know if there are any social media apps specific to BITS Pilani but someone could create a subreddit on Reddit r4r BITS Pilani like: https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/ but specific to BITS where people could post their requests anonymously and find mates. I hope someone does as it would help a lot of singles.

Nothing in my life is much sad. But something about everything makes me sad. It's as if it's my characteristic to be sad. Probably the first time, I know what Antonio was like. I hang out with friends, I chill, try to waste most of my time in work, studies (don't want to, EEE makes me do it). Then I feel like I haven't been sad today and I sit down and get sad.

But I don't know what to do about it. Like I would have talked to you without this confessions page but well you have a girlfriend and you are god damnit younger to me. The younger thing doesn't matter but your girlfriend does. I mean it's okay if you love her and with me it's just that you are intrigued. I understand. I was thinking what if it's not like that. You know I don't want you being a junior thing to be the only barrier. I want to talk. To you. Ok so I will take the lead because you might never have the courage. Just text me a simple hi after you read this. If both of us are getting this right, hopefully we can talk about it. P.s. I wanted to give some reference but couldn't think of anything that only you'll get. Anyway, if you think it's about you, high chances you're right. Matlab I don't think this entire situation is that common."
"1196","  Hey, this is for everyone out there who feels alone and sad, and thinks he/she is depressed. I have been where you are and have felt what you are feeling right now. I want to tell you that it gets better and that you can fight through it. It is important to take your time. Others will probably not understand, but that's just because they don't know what you are going through and not because they don't care. There will eventually come a moment, when you will realise that you have won. It may come very soon or it may take a while, but it WILL come. In the meantime, do not lose hope.  It is very important to take help. This can be talking to people you trust, like friends or family, whatever you are comfortable with. If you are not comfortable with that then it can be in the form of professional counselling, on or off Campus. Counsellor Emerson Scott and the new MPower centre are very important resources that you can reach out to. We have all heard jokes on these, but depression is a very serious and sensitive issue. So I would ask everyone on Campus to treat it as such."

Anyway, now that I've got it all out, I don't think I need to go to mpower now. Or maybe I do. Who knows. You all are the perfect audience. No judgment.

Then I found this person on an app... And I was so fascinated by the way we talked with each other. After about 2 weeks we exchanged phone numbers and we were talking. Somehow she kind of filled my life with new hope. Days passed and I graduated. Then during my convocation I missed her presence. I've thought about it... I felt I needed her. And I asked her out for a date. To my surprise she accepted to go on a date with me. And we planned to go on a special day... sometime during the end of the year. We were excited. Then comes the surprise. We started shedding tears for each other. Both of us knew something was off. And on 23rd September 2019 at 2 in the morning it happened. We were in love ❤️. We said that to each other.  And the irony is we never saw each other or met so far. Whoever you are, I'm waiting for you."

Nobody has any fucking clue about life but judgements on others are passed around like candy. Rumour mongering of the worst kind can be experienced here. Its a fucking spectacle, honestly. Watching you fuckers backstabbing and bitching about others the moment they turn their heads, it makes my day. Nobody is safe. Somebody is probably spreading rumours about you right now, as you read this. But the worst is the network of snitches this godforsaken college has. I mean, how cheap and low do you have to be to spy on your own fucking wingies and batchmates, your 'friends'? It boggles my mind.

The way these guys have started to behave has become equivalent to bullying and I mean it's legit bullying. Seriously people, why are you acting like entitled b*tches?!

I don't think there is a point in circulating slips in third year hostel. Those who want to donate will donate and others will not. Please donate the paper if you have extra to the underprivileged students. They can use it for study. Seniors please look into this as it is a serious issue for environment.

"843"," Instead of fee hike revolution, why can't we request the administration to simply remove MCN and proportionately reduce our fees. As such, we all know well of the kind of rich spoilt BITSians who misuse the MCN. Well, if this all seems so feasible, do you actually think that BITS administration is that dumb to ignore it all. I certainly feel, Mr. Birla, a businessman himself encourages the misuse of MCN by the parents who are business class. The next fee related protest requires this as it's objective. -2nd year guy"

I have literally seen porn of 100s of genres.  Soft porn, hard porn, erotica, hentai, porn comics, you name it, I have seen it.  The only thing that I haven't seen until now is pedo stuff, but that wouldn't be arousing for me.  I have seen coprophagia, gay, lesbian, straight, milf, gilf, secretary, nurse, doctor, incest.....and so on. I am really getting bored of porn. Tell me people, is the real stuff better than porn? Should I divert my attentions there? Just a point, I am not gay and not a fan of gay porn, and neither do I like coprophagia or similar shit. It was just to see whether I would like such stuff.

No chances from there on. Is this what you call a good campus culture? What's the point of having clubs and departments if a newbie never gets to even try. And the screening process literally sucks. And you boast of overall development. If anyone has ideas on how to change this, please comment below. Tag the heads of clubs, departments, Gen Sec and President. Please do something about this.

I want to leave her but she loves me now. Wish she could when I really needed her instead of screwing things up. Bc samajh hi nahi aa rahaa kya karu!! Don't want to hurt her and/ or be questioned by the many people around her who know. She's too emotional when it comes to me.

I'm not some desperate virgin who's just curious about sex.

Sir, I understand that after a hectic 4 years, these couple of months between college end and job are particularly boring. But please, stop being so fkn active on that group. You're bringing shame to our entire college, given that you're an alumnus now. And to all the soon-to-be second years, it's been a year since you wrote your JEE, get over the insecurity. If you actually want to prove BITS to be equal to an older IIT, get some quality papers out, file patents, come up with some world changing start-up idea, reduce global warming.

It’s awkward how suddenly a lot of people from our first year have taken up politics simply because the PORs attract them when clearly all they’ve been doing is lie. Quite recently we received a mail from a guy(won’t name him) for some kind of assistance in the form of a workshop or something where the undersigned designation was Students Union volunteer. When it’s quite clear that he’s not a volunteer. I’ve known him for a while. This is what I’m talking about. People will lie about anything for their profit these days. Smh.

Even when the machines worked, they had technical failures almost every other day. Now, it seems the people have stopped pretending to give a shit. I am really surprised that no one said anything about this until now. The machine hasn't been accepting cards since a month.

I guess not utilizing teen years to enhance your personality and just focusing on books does this to you. You'll be lonely if you try to force relationships.

And the stupid idiots in long distance, there are 3 scenarios, first you are cheating (good work), second your partner is cheating (well of course they have needs even if you don't you bloody asexual being), and third you are both honest (just breakup, a relationship in future between two asexual beings is never going to last). Also to all creepers out there don't make me name you, take a hint. To all singles out there, go ask someone out.

"651","Writing this confession at a point of the dark night,I want to give vent to my feelings ,which are sincere and real.Many people here see girls as objects,but I am not one of those.I want someone to share my feelings with,to love, someone who can rest their head on my shoulders, someone I can relate to.I may seem very indifferent on the outside,but I am not the same from inside!! Don't have the courage to tell who I am,buttt I certainly am a good person,and I don't know why,but I have become very pretentious after coming here.In reality,I am just the opposite.Hope that I find someone!!!!!"

"633","Yar ye mere roomie ke alarm ne naak mein dum kar diya hai. Subah toh usko uthna hona nahi hai, fir bhi voh alarm lagayega. Aisa nahi ki ek ya fir do teen alarm, voh har do minute ke liye ek alarm lagayega. Uske alarm band karte karte hi neend kharab ho jati hai. Chain ki neend so hi nahi pata. Aur voh toh raat Ko 3:00 sone ke Baad bhi subah 6:00 ka alarm lagata hai. Aur voh 6 o'clock se lekar 9 o'clock tak har do minute mein alarm bajega. Fir bhi voh nahi uthega jab tak mein ya koi wingie usko nahi utha deta. Kabhi kabhi toh man karta hai uska phone hi switch off kardu. Aur agar mein usko nahi uthata toh kabhi kabhi uski Mummy ka 7 o'clock mujhe phone aa jata hai. Abh main unko kaise samjhau ki yeh raat Ko 3 baje soya hai toh 7 baje kaise uthega. Upar se usko uthane ki koshish Kari toh life ke 30 minutes waste ho jate hai. Bhai tu bohot achha dost hai but tujhe bol kar bhi tu baz nahi aata.

Please take PS station with me...... We'll have a lot of fun together. Also I know all your 6-7 crushes and I've already warned them that they should stay away from you.

"609","This is for the most stylish guy I have seen on campus. I would rather say swag instead of style. I know that he is a first yearite , because he attends his Bio lectures with me . Also I saw him serving in the gujju Grub , and from than and that moment , I have started loving gujjus. I always see him with his group , laughing out loud and his jolly nature is like icing on the cake. I really mean to meet you. I would approach you in the next Gen Bio lecture , if you would have been wearing Blue or Red.(I would assume that you consider me for a talk.). Hoping to meet you. And please try me once. Love you. And one more thing , I love your smile."

"605","It's really depressing to not have any one in life. Get judged by people. Sometimes, it just feels as if it's better to accept that one is weak. Why have false pride for no good use? It's really disheartening to think that I have no one in life. And those who I have, made false promises. They're selfish. Being in a relationship does not bring any peace. It's just a gamble. Believe me. I've suffered and still am. Wish there were good suicidal spots on campus. And people, please stop judging others.

"598","Is any guy out there looking for a serious relationship? The problem with this place is nice guys don't approach and dickheads hawas vaale log mostly approach. So I think we need an anonymous matchmaking platform to get the deserving people dating.

"597","This is for the boys of the power-lifting team. Yes, not ""boy"", rather ""boys"" because it's not for a single boy, rather some of the members of the team (Don't know their names, else would have named them). Frankly, I didn't know that such a sport existed. Only recently, I came to know about it. But I had a crush on one of you since some time. Not just me, I know several other girls who are head over heels in love with many of you. All of them have boyfriends on campus, like me. But we need someone who can please us, support us and who can roam around with us in a tight tshirt showing his muscles making all other girls jealous. So which girl wouldn't trade a guy who's weak as a stick or roams around with a big belly for a guy who's fit, is strong and manly? You all just need to be more efficient in bringing up conversations with girls and you'll be ""having"" a girl in no time.

"595","To the CSE girl who was a regular at cafeteria,  I have always been intrigued by the way you speak, the grace with which you carry yourself. I tried speaking to you when you used to visit libraryt, but you were always surrounded by your friends. For an introvert like me, It would be a nightmare to approach crush before her peers.  But luckily I found her mail ID during lab sessions. And, using an online platform I sent an anonymous mail. Its been few hours since I sent but have received no reaction till now and the suspense is becoming unbearable.  Hoping to receive some sort of acknowledgement.  #HaseenDard  P.S: For those who want to know more about the platform, it is jodi365DotcomSlashcrush"

"583","This is in relation to confession #582 yes I totally agree with whatever you say!! I have trusted people on campus and they have turned out to be dogs and bitches . I don't think the college has a healthy atmosphere around. People only are nice to you when they need a favour from you .

"558","I have a morning ritual that I need to share. I call it ""the terminator"". First I crouch down in the shower in the classic ""naked terminator traveling through time"" pose. With my eyes closed I crouch there for a minute, visualizing either Arnold or the guy from the second movie (not the chick in the third one because that one sucked) and I start to hum the terminator theme. Then I slowly rise to a standing position and open my eyes. It helps me to proceed through my day as an emotionless, cyborg badass. The only problem is if the shower curtain sticks to my terminator leg. It ruins the fantasy  Admin note: ""I'll get a sem-back?"""

"514","I personally believe, The indian lady is a very different creature in terms of thought process , affection and love altogether, Indian ladies loves the men so diffently ,She don't broadcast ""I love you ,I love you "" 24*7 Like a western one , Rather she mixed the love in flour and turned it into a product that dilute into men blood ,She spread the un countable colours of love and sometimes she just served the PRICELESS two dropes of tears in the bowels of dinning table while waiting..and In the hard times she becomes The wall that prevent misfortune by turning into a fighter and basically gives a feeling that we are enjoying the life with companion of matching shoulder.In a nutshell she knows very well that love is not just a inning of a few seconds on bed that comes like sea waves that left sand and died fishes,But yes she knows her love is vast , stable,calm and intrupted delta of rivers that left the greenery of LOVE."

We all could just love in some secluded cottage deep inside a forest. You three can go outside and gather firewood and food while i cook lunch for you all and watch your manly souls so engrossed in striking the logs and sweat dripping through your sturdy chests. Oof.

"484","Imagine you're truly immortal, in space.  You jack it. Eventually, you will ejaculate. That ejaculation will give you a tiny, miniscule amount of thrust.  You jack it again the next day. Hell, maybe that same day, I don't judge. Same result. You shudder, a tiny amount of thrust.  Then again. And again. And again, over eons.  You will go faster and faster. Incredibly slowly, yes. But faster still. This is how ion engines work. Tiny amounts of thrust, but over long enough time scales you get serious results.  Eventually your jacking will propel you to an appreciable fraction of the speed of light. You'll be propelled across the cosmos at the end of light years long stream of gossamer wads.

I saw the expression on the mess worker's face, unable to express, which compelled me to sympathize with him.

"336"," This is just an appreciation post.  Hey Abdul,  You are really one of the good guys on campus. You are helpful, smart, kind, with an air of confidence and good vibes. Your notes are making rounds all over the campus ;). I think you are a bit reserved too. I am a believer that you have a lot going inside your head and prefer to stay silent. You are the guy who helps people in tests, sits on the last bench, brings just a book and a pen to class and still aces everything. People observe everything. Thankyou for being a gem. World needs more of you.  -Admirer"
"335"," This is for you, Soumya.  Girl, you're so beautiful. Like how could someone be this beautiful and yet so simple. I know you're in Coding Club as I've seen the Oasis snaps of CC, also that day, on the Oasis snaps, you were looking just gorgeous ♥ I mean those hairs, the flick, you, just looked perfect. I see you often near Krishna Reddy and sometimes around FK and SAC, you don't always smile, do you? But when you do, you can just melt any heart, you know. I've always seen you with your ADP Batchmates, I know many of them and I've talked to some, and yes that nose is cute ♥ Maybe we can be friends this coming sem?  - Freshie M  Admins Note: Pehle hi freindzoned kar diya"
"334"," Hmm....All these confessions and not a single one on our mystery clown here. Well then let me start. Dear Mr Pinkman( or whatever your real name is), dude there is no doubt that your level of humour is unmatched. I mean i am just reading the group chat, everyone is just blabbering about what the av is or when will this come and that and then there will be yours. Even at night I sometimes start giggling when some meme of yours comes in mind. But I think you are a big introvert from what i have heard. No one has seen you, there are only rumours xD. Mixed reactions like some say you are a big ghot and some say you are getting NCs (really?). So I am just saying that people must go offline too time to time. Do keep up the good work, and you look cute too( atleast in your whatsapp DP ;p) but get a life bro. We would meet someday in real life, i bet.  First year F  Admins Note: Pinkman, ye kon hai..."

Something and his lowest was 7.7 !He is physically fit and has a great health.Unlike many chutiyas here who have their bellies hanging out like it's their ninth month!!MERI advice hai ki pad lo bhailog air yeh confessions ki chodd do.And to be really honest ,Girls here are not even up to the mark!

I kind of stalked you and found out how great you were in your school days. I saw that video of yours dancing with other people and I just could not stop thinking about you after seeing that fun side of yours. I don't know if you have a gf or not, but I would love to be your friend if not gf. Hope to see you as soon as we reach campus.  ~1st yearite(F)  P.S.: I know you don't have a roomie....😉😉😘"

Also we have a lot of mutual friends from Sangam, still I couldn't gather the courage to approach you. Confession was the last option.

"132","""This is for a first yearite. I don't know his name but most probably he lives in S.R and is from DPS RK Puram(He has a black T-shirt).When I first interacted with him,I found him to be quite rude. I don't know why he sounded so arrogant but my opinion about him completely changed over the course of time. The way he was playing with an underprivileged group of kids and teaching them was quite good to see.(Maybe he's from NSS/Nirmaan). On 2-3 occasions ,I saw him feeding the street dogs . Some of his other antics also proved one point that inside that arrogant outlook,he has a soft side. You need to open up man otherwise you will miss out on lot of opportunities. You are such a good human being but for unknown reasons you try to act as someone who is unapproachable . Its been a week since I last saw you and don't know why but maybe I'm falling for you. If somebody knows him,kindly tag him so that he can mend his ways. Hoping to meet you soon.😊 2nd Year F' """

I just want you to know that You Belong With Me. You have done a very good job gaurding your virginity, but I will definitely steal it 😜😝🤗😚. I hope you take your eyes away from the stars and look at me someday. Fresher M"""

"83","This one is for the tall guy who performed a duet in the HCA Night. I don't know his name, but people were shouting """"Laamba Laamba"""", so I guess that must be his name/surname. I must say, you were looking very shy while performing those moves. It gave me an impression that you are a gentleman, and not one of the random lecherous guys, who form a majority here. But boy, let me tell you, your shyness made you look even hotter. I wish I was the one dancing in the dark(albeit in spotlight) , with you between my arms. I wish I could get to meet you sometime. - A second yearite, F(obv)"""

"81","I saw you once in Shankar 169. Your tail was what really got me. My heart skipped a beat and I felt that I had a purpose for my existence. I am looking for a lifetime long relationship with you .( You know who you are) You are a student of my dream stream, General Studies, but my parents forced me to take CS because they knew that all the sexy ones were in General Studies. I live in Shankar 333, and I hope that we can meet. I'd love it if we meet on 30 February of 1936. I'll be there wearing a necklace like those French girls. You'll recognise me immediately, it's hard to mistake me for someone else, unlike Johnny. Please don't ignore me. Love, the resident of Shankar 333."""

"67","ife at BITS totally sucks. Teachers tend to teach in such a way by assuming that we know everything. A quite famous math Prof. :P ...surely doesn't know what level of questions to give in tut. Tests. Level of questions in tut test should be same for each section but one Prof especially tends to give the most difficult ones which you won't even find in the textbook. Talking of electrical science 😂..EACH and every Prof. starts teaching as if everyone here in the class are already engineers and know everything..they usually skip the basics which are very important to explain...overall academics at BITS totally sucks according to me. !"
"66","k, So this is gonna take a hell lot of guts, to get this out of my head and to your heart(if possible😉😉). So I first saw you at rotunda on first....no no second August or.....ok leave it, whatever I saw you and that is what matters. You seemed like every other guy at campus, casually interacting with every one, but there was something about you that felt different. Then I saw you at Akash Chand Rai's thermo lecture and everytime I tried to sit near you, you would just cling to all those friends of yours😡😡. Then I saw you in that clean shaved look😍😍😍😘 on Music night, and I just fell for you. Let's meet at PCA night, at the same place you generally sit (yes I am a stalker😉😉).

I've always wanted to talk to you, but have never had the courage to talk to you since you are always surrounded by other guys. I once sat in front of him in Ashish Tiwari's lecture and heard him talking about NSS CLP, so I guess he is a part of that.

"49","his is for the cutest second yearite guy on campus Amol Agarwal. I often see you in M3 lectures solving questions diligently. This makes me feel that you're a ghot. But what's wrong in being a ghot if he's so cute. Moreover, you can teach me M3 as I really hate that course. Your huge figure gives me a feel that your ""equipment"" will be good enough to make me feel good (perks of a huge boyfriend :p). I often see you with HPC girls and it makes me go crazy. Hopefully you aren't committed because I can surely offer more than any of them. Just one look at your ever-smiling face makes me feel lucky and satisfied. I have been stalking you since 1-2 and I've noticed that you've become fitter than before (good for me ;p). I'll be waiting for you at T-lawns on saturday 11pm. I'll be wearing a black top.

Yes, I'm a man, Yes, I'm confessing my attraction towards a man, No, I'm not ashamed anymore. I've always dreamt of a hairy guy like you. You're everything I could ask for. 1 month back, when i stepped in the campus gate, I saw you, standing there, you looked so amazing from back that I couldn't resist watching your front. And it was breathtaking. You're from EEE, Bengali and your name is something Ab**********. My previous boyfriend was also Bengali. Don't be insecure now, I'm over him (figuratively and literally xD).

Never cut that beard. I will be meeting you soon, if my shyness allows it. Please don't date any girls till then. If you loose a few kilos you'll look even more dashing. P.S. yuo look better without specs A First year, F"

"22","here's this guy, who attends the 10am Gen Bio lectures. He's the one with a lot of doubts. Typical ghot like characteristics - thick specs, lean guy. But, somehow, everytime he speaks, my heart skips a beat ❤ I heard from a friend that he's from CS and his BITSAT score was 400+. I so want to get to know him better. Please, if you are reading this, look around in the next Gen Bio lecture; I'll be giving you subtle hints ;-) First-yearite girl❤"
"21","his confession is for a 2nd year, Shrey.  I didn't know your name till yesterday when you came to manoj kannan's lecture to play some video. Got to know about you from my friend sitting next to me. Honestly I have seen you many times interacting with juniors and working for NSS. I found you cute and thought of approaching at least for interactions but my less courageous nature held me back. I wish I gather the courage soon and at that time you are free to approach! Hope to meet you soon"

"16","his confession is for Anjali kiroriwal , second yearite. I am in love with you girl. You r kind, funny, sweet, smart, caring, pretty all at same time... You r everything I love. It is truly love at first sight. I come to gymG just to see u .My feelings for you grow every day, and my love grows deeper with every passing minute. You mean so much to me.

Every time I think about you, it gives me more strength to carry on my life. It makes me happy to be alive, knowing that you've come into my life. All I know is that I want to be with you!"
"15","hen I was in school used to think that studies in college will be fun and interesting, unlike school or JEE Prep. But on coming here I'm seriously disappointed. Most people care about marks more than the learning. Also the chemistry lab people make it so uninteresting and boring, taking the fun of it. Like seriously why."
"14","n the music nite yesterday, can someone tell me the name of the hot lead singer in black dress? P.S. Girl, if you are reading this, you are extremely talented and hot! 😍"

I'm hypnotysed by your destiny. We met in NSS, at first i thought you were a senior but then I got to know u are a fresher . My heart fell Immediately when I saw you for the first time. You look cute in short hairs, that's what attracts me the most. You didn't come in the last NSS tour, I missed u a lot. Hope we meet soon❤️"
"12"," really like this fresher girl in EEE. The way she smiles all day is refreshing. I really feel like we would make an amazing couple. Even though, I am good with talking to girls, I, somehow, am not getting the desired response and inclination from her side. Can someone help me out here? I don't understand. A fresher guy."
"11","ey, I'm a fresher. Let me start by describing myself. Kinda brown, kinda funny, kinda kind and totally looking for love. Got out of a relationship a few months ago and I find myself looking for love in everyone, everything and it kinda gets lonely. So here I am, writing this for a girl who could possibly be the love of my life. My type is sweet, caring and loving(and a little naughty :P).So if you wanna be friends and explore things together, comment on below. Or if you're uncomfortable just hit me up at https://chandler221b.sarahah.com/  Looking forward to meet you. :) I'll always be there for you ;)"
"10","ey, I'm a fresher, from Mechanical branch. I'm looking for a sweet, loving girl who needs a friend and wants to explore things together. I know this is a little pathetic, but sometimes girls with beautiful personalities stay hidden and I just want them to reach out to me through this if they wanna try this out. Please comment if you want to meet or want my number. I'm decent looking and I think I'm sweet and kind, so just check me out if you'd like to. Peace. :)"
"9","pid is said to be the shape of love but my love for you is circular coz infinity is circular in shape. There is a girl in chemical branch(i guess) who have captured my heart my brain my eyes since i saw her. Fortunately she is from my home town (i am a misal lover) and so i always dream about traveling back home with her."
"8","is confession is for the EEE fresher boy from Mumbai, whom I want to be the love of my life. I know u r reading this and it's u who has been described in this confession. I fell in love with you for the first time I saw your photo on our WhatsApp group of MEERA BHAWAN. U look great from the right side & that sticker of cock on your photo has made you famous by the name of BBC. Let me tell you that for me the size really matters & I would love to take a ride on your BBC (this is not lust but my love for you). I have all your information - name, id, branch etc.. yesterday I saw you at LTC and I was mesmerized by your look and height. All I need is you you you.. Now it's your task to find me. I'm always there somewhere near you during lectures as we have an almost same time table. LOVE YOU Mr. K"
"7","is confession is for Jyotiranjan. I have heard that your nick name is Ayaan. When I first lolked at you in LTC, you looked like a total asshole. Also the way you talk is totally shitty. I couldn't understand why the fuck do you have that attitude. Later on I realised that I was right about you. I don't know how but somehow I have fallen for you. Hope to meet you soon. FRESHie(feMALE)"
"6","is is for a girl called Parul. I heard she is in HCA, and NSS, and her beauty is beyond comparison to anyone else in our batch. I fell for her the moment she crossed my eyes. I know there are other boys but I am the one for you. I always stalk you in chemistry lab and seriosly I just love you. Let's meet sometime because I just can't wait to do that.

"5","y! So, this is for a girl(idk what her name is). Damn! Girl you seriously look like Scarlett Johansonn.I have been noticing you since day 1 here in BITS. I get to see you only on MWF and that too only in Gen Chem lecture, LTC-5102.On 23rd you were wearing Black Tshirt and Blue jeans. On 24th Aug, You were wearing Blue Tshirt and Jeans. You have pink coloured bag. That ponytail hairstyle suits you. You look very pretty in that 😊. You look even prettier during the lecture when you wear specs 😍. You come 2-3 mins late daily in class, keep doing that so that I can see you atleast for a few seconds. Always sit at the place where you were sitting today.Gen Chem lectures are usually boring but your presence makes it very interesting for me. I burn with jealousy when I see other guys talking to you.I'm pretty dumb when it comes to girls but hey, I'll approach you one day for sure.  Till that day comes, keep smiling in class it adds to your gorgeousness.  PS: You're waaaayyy out of my league.😭"
"4","dn't know this page existed for bits pilani too. Fucking hell. Anyways, I dont know understand this feeling i have had for days. Common lectures were a start, manoj kanan doesn't seem to impress me anymore, and now i stalk you whenever i see you. I dont know your name yet, but you went for the football practice.You live in SR i guess. Also, your friends seem to be from gurgaon, well you stay with them most of the times. You have that athletic body like the body issue. Can you please meet me sometime? Just try to notice the people around you. You will surely find me there."
"3","e relationships between departments is fucking toxic in here. The recruitment process is too obvious and I don’t like it."
"2","niors are dipshits. They should've organised a fresher's party."
"1","ere is this guy in one of my whatsapp groups with a fake identity (probably) as jesse pinkman. And I really find him very cute and I just want to meet him someday, although I won’t tell my name now. And I see he is a little bit ‘bakchod’ too. XD. There, I vented it out. Also fuck you, aman."
